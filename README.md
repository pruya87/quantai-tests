# 🧠 AI & ⚛️ Quantum Playground

Welcome to a collection of personal experiments and educational deep dives across the fascinating worlds of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Quantum Computing**.

This repository is primarily for:
- Exploring and understanding foundational and advanced techniques
- Testing ideas and reproducing concepts from papers, tutorials, or research
- Building a consistent and reusable knowledge base

Some of the implementations are inspired by existing works; all credits are acknowledged wherever applicable.
